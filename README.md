**BFain** (Battlefield AI Nexus) is a Semantic Operating System concept designed to revolutionize Command & Control (C2). It addresses the critical "Packet Loss" in Human-to-Machine communication by replacing manual micromanagement with **Kinetic Intent Routing**.

## 🎯 The Mission
Modern warfare suffers from high **Bio-Latency** and **Cognitive Overload**.
* **The bottleneck:** Operators cannot effectively control drone swarms using joysticks and voice commands in real-time.
* **The solution:** BFain treats the battlefield as a network topology. The operator defines the *Intent* (e.g., "Neutralize", "Flank"), and the AI executes the *Kinetic Action* (pathfinding, ballistics, coordination).

## ⚡ Key Features (v1.5 Prototype)

This repository hosts a live functional prototype demonstrating the core UX/UI principles:

### 1. Strategic Overwatch ("God View")
* Real-time topology visualization of assets (Satellites, Swarms, HQ).
* Visual representation of data links and command range.

### 2. Autonomous Swarm Logic
* **Carrier Ops (Mothership):** Demonstration of a heavy carrier drone deploying autonomous sub-drones.
* **Tactical Maneuvers:** AI-driven execution of complex strategies like **Pincer Movements** and **Flanking** with a single click.
* **Auto-Loop:** The system automatically scans, detects threats, and proposes solutions. The operator only needs to *approve*.

### 3. Accessible Warfare ("The Wounded Warrior")
* **Zero-Motor Interface:** Designed to be operated via **Eye-Tracking** or simple clicks.
* **Inclusion:** Enables wounded veterans (amputees, paralyzed operators) to remain valuable strategic assets, utilizing their combat experience without requiring physical dexterity.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Core:** Native JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
* **Visualization Engine:** [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (Data-Driven Documents) for dynamic topology rendering.
* **Architecture:** Frontend-only concept (Rapid Prototyping).

## 🔮 Roadmap: The "Zero Latency" Doctrine

BFain is built with a 3-phase evolution path, moving from manual input to pure thought control.

* **Phase 1: Touch/Click (Current)**
    * Building the dataset of tactical decisions. Reducing the OODA loop to seconds.
* **Phase 2: Spatial (AR/VR)**
    * Native integration with HUDs. Soldiers see "Intent Lines" overlaid on reality.
* **Phase 3: Neural (BCI)**
    * Integration with **Neuralink**.
    * **Goal:** Pre-Cognitive Control. Executing intent milliseconds *before* the operator consciously formulates the command, bypassing biological lag entirely.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3.  **Simulation Guide:**
    * Wait for the **AUTO-SCAN** to detect a `Z-FORCE` threat.
    * When **"AWAITING DECISION"** appears, select a yellow Intel Node (e.g., *OP C: PINCER SWARM*).
    * Observe the autonomous execution and Return-to-Base (RTB) logic.
    * *Tip:* You can manually drag Drones and Satellites to adjust formation. The HQ is GPS-locked.
